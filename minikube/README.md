# Kubernetes - Homelab

### ðŸ”¥ Best Choice for Homelab?

minikube is a great choice for local Kubernetes development and testing. It allows you to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, making it easy to experiment with Kubernetes features and configurations.

**âš¡ Note:** You need docker or a VM driver (like KVM) to run minikube. It is not a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster but rather a simplified version for local development.

I still recommend using k3s for better performance and resource management in a homelab environment. k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that is optimized for resource-constrained environments, making it ideal for homelabs.

### ðŸ¤“ minikube

Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that runs a single-node cluster on your local machine. It is ideal for development, testing, and learning Kubernetes without needing a full-scale cluster.

**Use Cases:**
- Local Development: Test Kubernetes configurations and applications locally.
- Learning Kubernetes: Experiment with Kubernetes features in a controlled environment.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Use Minikube for testing Kubernetes deployments in CI workflows.
- Integration Testing: Validate how applications interact within a Kubernetes cluster.
- Homelab Setup: Integrate with tools like libvirt, Docker, and Portainer for a self-contained Kubernetes environment.

**Expected**
- Easy to integrate with libvirt network
- Integration with KVM, Docker
- Integration with Portainer
- Developer Experience

### ðŸ‘€ **Steps**

Make sure to have the following installed:
```shell
â‹Š> ~ sudo virsh net-list --all                                                                                                                                                                 20:30:02
 Name      State    Autostart   Persistent
--------------------------------------------
 default   active   yes         yes
```
Once we have the network up and running, we can start Minikube with the `kvm2` driver and specify the network to use.
```shell
minikube start --driver=kvm2 --network=default
```
